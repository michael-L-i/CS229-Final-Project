# CS229-Final-Project

**Attack**

Our attack takes on two different ResNets. Both are trained on the ICL Dataset (https://www.commsp.ee.ic.ac.uk/~pld/research/Rewind/Recapture/). The difference is that one is based on the original images in the dataset while the latter (the physics based colab), is trained on the wavelet transformed versions of the images in the dataset.

**Defense**
